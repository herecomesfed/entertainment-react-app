## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate between Home, Movies, TV Series, and Bookmarked Shows pages
- Add/Remove bookmarks from all movies and TV series
- Search for relevant shows on all pages
- **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application
- **Bonus**: If you're building a full-stack app, we provide authentication screen (sign-up/login) designs if you'd like to create an auth flow
